Hibernate is a powerful Java framework that simplifies the task of interacting with databases. It provides a way to map Java objects to database tables and vice versa, allowing you to work with Java objects in your code instead of directly dealing with SQL queries. Here's a brief overview of how Hibernate works:<br>

1. **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)**: Hibernate uses ORM to map Java classes to database tables and Java data types to SQL data types. This allows you to work with Java objects in your code and have Hibernate translate these objects into database operations.<br>

2. **Configuration**: Hibernate requires a configuration file (`hibernate.cfg.xml` or `hibernate.properties`) to specify database connection details and other settings. This file tells Hibernate how to connect to the database and what mapping rules to use.

3. **SessionFactory**: The SessionFactory is a thread-safe, immutable cache of compiled mappings for a single database. It is created from the configuration and is used to obtain Session instances.
<br>

4. **Session**: A Session is a lightweight, short-lived object representing a single unit of work with the database. It provides methods to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) database operations. Sessions are obtained from the SessionFactory and should be closed when no longer needed.
<br>

5. **Transaction**: A Transaction represents a single atomic unit of work with the database. All database operations within a transaction are treated as a single unit of work, and they are either all committed or all rolled back if an error occurs.
<br>

6. **Entities and Relationships**: Hibernate allows you to define entity classes that represent database tables. You can define relationships between entities using annotations or XML mapping files.
<br>

7. **Querying**: Hibernate provides a powerful query language called Hibernate Query Language (HQL), which is similar to SQL but operates on Java objects instead of database tables. HQL queries are translated into SQL queries by Hibernate.
